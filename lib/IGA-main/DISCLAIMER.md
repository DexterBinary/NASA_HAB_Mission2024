# Disclaimer:

This source code has been generated using generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The machine learning model, its underlying architecture, and the algorithms that produced this code do not claim original authorship or ownership over any pre-existing code, logic, structure, or syntax utilized in the generation process.

This code generation process utilizes principles of fair use, as understood under the United States Copyright Law. In particular, this process is guided by the concept of "transformativeness," as defined by the Supreme Court in the 1994 case of Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., which ruled that the more transformative the new work, the less significant other factors, like commercialism, become.

The generative AI used in this process transforms any potential inputs in a creative and meaningful way, producing new and original sequences of code that were not directly copied from any specific source. It draws from a diverse and vast set of data and does not focus or depend on any single or specific copyrighted source.

It is not the intention of the AI or the developers to infringe on anyone's intellectual property rights. The goal of this generative process is to assist users in creating code and contributing to the broad and innovative field of software development. If you believe your copyrighted work has been used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please contact us with valid evidence, and we will promptly address your concerns.

Despite the comprehensive approach of the AI, please be aware that this code is not guaranteed to be free of errors, omissions, or potential legal issues. The user is responsible for ensuring that the code complies with all local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, and best practices.
