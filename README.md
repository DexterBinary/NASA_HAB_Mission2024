MaxIQ Space has secured eight payloads on the NASA high altitude balloon launch from New Mexico in August of 2024. Our mission is to design and build an experiment using the XChips to be sent on the balloon. Our experiment may include any of the MaxIQ Space XChips, including but not limited to, the VOC2 meter, a barometer, a temperature sensor, an accelerometer, an ambient light sensor, etc. We may also use our own sensors mounted onto the XChip breadboards. The largest constraint we have is space as we are allowed 3x3 XChip space with 8mm of clearance.
